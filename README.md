# cup-task
This program simulates the "cup task" experiment using input shaping and
employs nonlinear optimization to find impedance values that best fit
individual human subject trials. The optimization requires the NLOpt
library to run (https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Choose desired optimization parameters in optimizationCall.m and run!
